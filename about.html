<p><img src="MyPic.JPG" width="50%">
  Born and raised in in Detroit 25 years.  I was a tough
  lad.  Worked at a local supermarket as a packer and 
  stock clerk.  Later moved to Warren and began a career
  with a small auto supplier.  Moved to Sterling Heights
  and began down the path of software developer.  Currently
  living in Howell, it's now a struggle to keep up with
  current technologies.  Retirement can't come soon enough.
